# HR Analytics and Employee Attrition Dashboard
This project is an "HR Analysis and Attrition Dashboard" case study built using Power BI and Tableau. The goal is to explore key workforce metrics such as attrition trends, employee demographics, department performance, work-life balance, and promotion timelines. The dashboards help in identifying retention patterns and business risks associated with human capital.

## Project Overview
Modern HR systems collect extensive employee data across departments, roles, and performance metrics. This project uses those datasets to answer questions like:
• "What is the overall attrition rate?"
• "Which departments and roles are most affected?"
• "How does promotion history relate to attrition?"
• "Are there differences in attrition by age, gender, or department?"
• "What does work-life balance look like across roles?"

Two interactive dashboards were developed:
1. "Power BI Dashboard" – A high-level KPI overview and department-level attrition analysis
2. "Tableau Dashboards (2 pages)" – Deep-dive into attrition by job roles, age, promotions, and work-life balance

## Tools & Technologies
• "Excel" – For initial data cleaning and structuring
• "Power BI" – For building KPI dashboards and visual interaction layers
• "Tableau" – For analytical storytelling and drill-down exploration
• "Data Source" – Simulated HR dataset (likely Kaggle or provided in coursework)

## Power BI Dashboard:

### Key Insights:
• "Total Employees: 50,000"
• "Total Attrition: 25,105 (50%)"
• "Active Employees: 24,895"
• "Average Age: 38.97"

### Visuals Included:
• "Work-life balance by job role" (Research roles have slightly lower scores)
• "Average hourly rate by department" (Software tops at 116.26)
• "Attrition by department" (Highest: R\&D at 51.21%)
• "Attrition count by last promotion year" (Most attrition after 6–7 years without promotion)
• "Monthly income vs. attrition rate by job role"

## Tableau Dashboard – Page 1
### Key Metrics:
• "Employee Count: 13,970"
• "Attrition Count: 7,041 (50.4%)"
• "Average Age: 23 (focused on 18–30 age category)"
• "Employees Remaining: 6,929"

### Highlights:
• "Salary hike distribution among attrited vs. retained employees (18–30 age group)"
• "Employee distribution by age bin (18 to 30)"
• "Attrition by gender and age group" (Males slightly more likely to leave)
• "Work-life balance across job roles" (Developer and Research roles show lower balance)

### Visual Breakdowns:
• "Average total working years by department" (Software and Support have higher experience levels)
• "Average attrition rate by department" (Highest: Hardware and R\&D at 50.71%)
• "Attrition count by job role" (Top 3: Sales Executive, Sales Rep, Healthcare Rep)
• "Average last year since promotion by job role" (Research roles go longest without promotions)
• "Income distribution across roles and education fields" (Sales & Managerial roles highest)

## Insights
• "Overall attrition rate is 50%, with Research and Sales roles being heavily impacted"
• "Work-life balance is lower in high-skill roles (Developer, Research Director)"
• "Younger employees (18–30) show significant attrition despite salary hikes"
• "Delayed promotions (5–7 years) correlate with increased attrition risk"
• "Credit card payment (Power BI insight) and longer shipping delay (from previous analysis) might parallel delayed HR benefits here"
• "Attrition rate is balanced across genders but slightly higher for males"
• "Departments with higher average working years also face higher attrition"

## Future Improvements
• Add "Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression / XGBoost)" for attrition forecasting
• Use "Cohort Analysis" to see trends in employee tenure and retention
• Introduce "Sentiment Analysis on Exit Interviews" if available
• Create "Automated Power BI data pipelines" to keep dashboards live
• Enable "Role-based filters" for real-time HR team usage

## Learning Outcomes
• Built "interactive HR dashboards in Power BI and Tableau"
• Explored "correlation between promotions, attrition, and work-life balance"
• Gained experience in "HR metrics analysis and employee behavioral patterns"
• Understood "the importance of early promotion and balanced workload"
• Designed "data-driven visualizations to support strategic HR decision-making"
